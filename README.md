# Clean React Project Setup

This is a clean version of the create-react-app project template which contains react-router-dom already set up.
In addition you have a minimal folder structure that suits all beginner to intermediate projects.

  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>

## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have the latest Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/michaelparkadze/clean-react-project-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
4.  Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._

Now you're ready to start coding!

> Please note that this boilerplate is **meant for beginner to intermediate developers**! If you're just starting out with react or redux this is a good example of a project setup. If you looking for a **production ready** , battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, I recommend [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).
